# Exercise Correction AI Model - Physiotherapy

An AI-powered system for correcting and analyzing physiotherapy exercises using computer vision and machine learning.

## Overview

This project implements an AI model that can analyze and provide corrections for physiotherapy exercises. The system uses pose detection and machine learning algorithms to evaluate exercise form and provide feedback.

## Features

- Real-time exercise analysis
- Pose detection and tracking
- Exercise form correction
- Model deployment utilities
- Geometry calculations for movement analysis

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- ONNX

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Basic usage instructions will be added as the project develops.

## Project Structure

- `utils/` - Utility modules for model deployment and geometry calculations
- `requirements.txt` - Project dependencies

## License

This is a graduation project for physiotherapy exercise correction.
